## General Info

The Magic 8-Ball is a plastic toy that looks like an eight-ball, and is currently manufactured by Mattel. <br>
It is used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. It was invented in 1950 by Albert C. Carter and Abe Bookman. <br>
The user asks a yesâ€“no question to the ball, then turns it over to reveal an answer in a window on the ball.  <br>
There are 20 possible answers:
